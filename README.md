# ARK-Invest-Square-Valuation-Extract

Square Valuation Extract.
Published 30/9/2020.

To foster healthy debate, we have published an extract of our Square valuation model. Intentionally, we have not incorporated the potential for Square’s international business, an important call option. Feel free to change variables to battle test our assumptions and share your thoughts with us. We will welcome all questions, feedback, and constructive criticism. Modifiable variables are marked in red.
